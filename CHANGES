Release history for gitary

v17.06  2017-06-16
  [Changed]
  - "--blob $entry" now prints the full path to this entry's blob
    directory.
  - "--blob" now always requires you to specify an entry.
  - "--continue" now continues with the *last* entry, not necessarily
    the last entry *today*.

v17.03  2017-03-11
  [Changed]
  - When invoked without arguments, gitary now shows the last $n items
    (the default being 10). Can be customized by setting
    $GITARY_RECENT_ITEMS.

v16.09  2016-09-03
  [Changed]
  - This is a major and backwards-incompatible rewrite of gitary.
  - The directory and file layout has been changed: There now is one
    directory for each day and one subdirectory for each entry that day.
    Blobs now belong to an entry, rather than to a day.
  - Gitary is now almost completely agnostic of the file format you use.
    The first line of a file should contain a subject. Optionally, there
    can be a "tag" line. By default, gitary creates files with an ".md"
    extension (suggesting Markdown), but you can easily change that.
  - Blobs can no longer be tagged. Instead, as they now belong to one
    individual entry, you could say that they inherit this entry's tags.
  - Many command line options have been removed since I never use them,
    others have been renamed.
  - There is a utility script to convert old-style repos to the new
    layout.

v16.08 and earlier releases
  - Sorry, the CHANGES file did not exist back then. Please refer to the
    Git log.

Release history for gitary

next
  [Changed]
  - This is a major and backwards-incompatible rewrite of gitary.
  - The directory and file layout has been changed: There now is one
    directory for each day and one subdirectory for each entry that day.
    Blobs now belong to an entry, rather than to a day.
  - Gitary is now almost completely agnostic of the file format you use.
    The first line of a file should contain a subject. Optionally, there
    can be a "tag" line. By default, gitary creates files with an ".md"
    extension (suggesting Markdown), but you can easily change that.
  - Many command line options have been removed since I never use them,
    others have been renamed.
  - There is a utility script to convert old-style repos to the new
    layout.

v16.08 and earlier releases
  - Sorry, the CHANGES file did not exist back then. Please refer to the

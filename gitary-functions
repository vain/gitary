.TH GITARY 1  "February 2010" "Git-Diary" "A diary using Git"
.SH NAME
gitary \- a diary using
.BR git (1)
as a backend.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgitary\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
By default, \fBgitary\fP starts your favourite editor (via the
\fBEDITOR\fP environment variable) to edit the entry for the current
day. When you leave the editor, anything you've changed in the data
directory (see the \fBDATADIR\fP variable at the beginning of this
script) will be committed into the git repository.
.P
Maybe you should also have a look at the example configuration.
.SH OPTIONS
All of these options are optional and mutual exclusive. Note that they
do not need to start with a hyphen.
.TP
\fBtags\fP \fIword ...\fP
Search for tags. Prints out each entry if its tagline includes one of
the given words or a part of such a word.
.TP
\fBrefs\fP \fIword ...\fP
Search in references. Prints out each entry if it contains a reference
like \fI\(lq\-\- Einstein\(rq\fP or \fI\(lq[1] www.archlinux.org\(rq\fP.
That is, references start with two dashes and one blank at the beginning
of a line \(em but you can also use a number in square brackets instead.
.TP
\fBsearch\fP \fIword ...\fP
Search entire entries. Same as \fBtags\fP but searching is not limited
to taglines or references.
.TP
\fBedit\fP \fIday\fP
Edit the given day. Expects the format \fIYYYY\-MM\-DD\fP, i.e.
\fI2009\-09\-31\fP.
.TP
\fBgitk\fP
Launch \fBgitk\fP(1) in the data directory.
.TP
\fBviewall\fP
Show all entries in chronological order in the program specified in
your \fBPAGER\fP environment variable.
.TP
\fBpull\fP
Pulls from your git remote by doing a \fBgit pull\fP in the data
directory. Does not check whether such a remote exists.
.SH NOTES
You have to do a \fBgit init\fP the data repository before you can use
this script. However, if you don't do this, the script will ask you what
to do.
.P
There's a syntax highlighting scheme for
.BR vim (1)
ready to be used in the \fB.vim/\fP subdirectory. Thus, you should get
the best experience when using this script together with \fBvim\fP.
